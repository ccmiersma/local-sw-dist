Local Software Distribution
===========================

This package will install the base environment for a custom software distribution.
This can serve as a starting point for a complete integrated set of scripts, configurations,
and custom applications local to your organization.

This sets up a software tree similar to /usr/ or /usr/local under /opt/local, or
the path of your choice. This allows packaged scripts to be easily distinguished
from the operating system and third-party vendors.
